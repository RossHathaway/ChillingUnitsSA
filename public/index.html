  <h1>Almond Climate Comparison</h1>
  <p>
    The purpose of this website is to provide climate data from <a href="https://darksky.net">Dark Sky</a> comparing the climates of almond-producing regions in Califorina and Southern Africa. California is the largest producer of almonds in the world, and the climate is ideal (<a href="http://www.almonds.com/sites/default/files/content/Technical%20%20Information%20Kit.pdf">source</a>). I have wondered for some time if almonds could be grown in Southern Africa, so I wanted to collect climate data to compare the two regions that could be analyzed to determine the suitability of Southern Africa's climate for almond growing.
